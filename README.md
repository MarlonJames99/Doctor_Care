## Project:
This is a webpage to a medical assistance company called "DoctorCare". The page gives information about the company, services offered and how the clients can make contact.<br>

This project was made through the event "Next Level Week - Return", more specifically the "Origin" trail, presented by Rocketseat in may 2022.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.<br>
The page was developed in mobile first and is responsive, adapting itself correctly to different devices. We have also adapted it to desktop scale using media queries.<br>
We gave a big focus on many aspects related to accessibility and I'm very confident that people with special needs will be able to use it very properly!

## Next steps:
> I'm going to develop a "testimonials section" to the page aswell<br><br>
> It's missing the Favicon image.
